### Install Automation Platform 


Install `subscription-manager`

```bash
sudo yum install -y subscription-manager
```



Register VM with Red Hat package repos

```bash
sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach
```



When prompted, provide your Red Hat Developer username and password.

Click [Here](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480) to download the Ansible Automation Platform installer. 

* Log in to the portal 

* At the top, change the Version to the latest for `RHEL 8`

* Click the "Download Now" link on the "Bundle" installer

Copy the installer to the lab VM. 

## Macos/Linux
Use `scp` to copy the setup file from your local machine to the Ansible Control node.



## Windows

Copy the installer to the lab VM using WinSCP:


Create a new connection to the lab server:

- Change File protocol to SCP
- Enter the Hostname of the Lab VM
- Enter the username provided by the instructor

Configure SSH Key Authentication:

* Browse the key provided by the instructor.

![img](https://winscp-static-746341.c.cdn77.org/data/media/screenshots/login_authentication.png?v=6990)



After connecting, copy the download setup file to the Lab VM in `/home/ec2-user`

<img src="https://winscp-static-746341.c.cdn77.org/data/media/screenshots/commander.png?v=6990" alt="img" style="zoom:85%;" />



Connect to the server using SSH



Extract the installer 

If the file is a ``.tar`` run:

```bash
tar -xvf ansible-automation-platform-setup-*.tar
```

If the file is a `.tar.gz` run:

```bash
tar -zxvf ansible-automation-platform-setup-*.tar.gz
```



Enter directory 

```bash
cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<version>
```



The latest version of AAP does not support installation on `localhost`. Due to this, we need to add the following to `/etc/hosts`

Using `sudo` open `/etc/hosts` in your favorite editor. 

```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```



Now add `aap.localhost.com` to the end of the line beginning with `127.0.0.1` so it looks like this:

```
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 aap.localhost.com
```

Save the file and run the following to test.

```
ping aap.localhost.com
```



Delete the original inventory file

```bash
rm -rf inventory
```



Create a new `inventory` file and paste the following into it.

```
[automationcontroller]
aap.localhost.com ansible_connection=local

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password='Password1234'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='Password1234'

registry_url='registry.redhat.io'
registry_username='15765574|ansible-tower'
registry_password='eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJlZTBmNDllNzE1ZWQ0MmQ3YjZkNzk2MWRiZDA1ZDgwNCJ9.APx3LOHNzp4O2pNewBL5X2CR84vJqL24wPBuEtUfQUU6ckP4CJcYIl2lyr9NQCcapG1rtoTiAp4NHstmroi-m_nCOcr1he8vMsUSNGMKqT-tBr-oe84bENmYM_DNvbQReh1pW4c6D2VQFXC9iN60vNl4cylBSy4BWFeg3Dgj62RQSgDAr8RX4twjh0BDbIE75IcVLK2cyvHTqmSst9kk0q9_iAAvGokxRkEHwurkPg6VCZ0MFG3O6GRtVCVS055mGR6P48Wzhwvm698GKHferVyt-0AqWox83hvQWB-pvRmOgkZyFnsdlHpHNIzCN1_g7LQmkk-Lqw0NYanqU-ag8yHnv_RO4HpOI-PAWponrFk7lU3HRBOAjeyHiW60FwgTtDOftTi7Gz-Uer8mcZfLoyMfByYoK8BUc7lNhCPvG32qkEMkbdB7TFSRmIVqgh3VQ3m8OYCu7IrD3qpLA3faydQIqa8h_XMs9umrSvpb7kctDVrTqwQvZp3rZqZbJE5-qL_xwdgdTCZcVE5JBa8Rhr962K5sLVJLfWRqkAoK3agmzXFYbl16VNtoAfeMblyOK_jQc-WMycxr7C0aQAHQ18Y7zRBVJyRplwyuc1k-zjcZA9GBvhW35fF-NyNIMF2qga-Rz2z_0zOw8zkP1Ioug--sRz8Tgz47UMphlkm'
```

Set the following in the `inventory` file (if not already completed) 

* admin password = Password1234   
* pg_password = Password1234   
* registry_username = The username generated earlier in the lab (i.e 15765574|ansible-tower)   
* registry_password = The token you generated earlier in the lab.   

Run installation script

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh -e required_ram=2048
```





**NOTE**: This will take some time to complete.



After the script above completes, you can access the Dashboard at the following URL (replacing `Server IP` with your lab VM IP)  

https://[Server IP]/#/login



Log into the dashboard with the username `admin` and the password you specified in the `inventory` file `Password1234`



> NOTE: You can reset the admin password by running the following on the Ansible Control VM:
>
> ```bash
> sudo awx-manage changepassword admin
> ```



You will see a screen asking to register Automation Platform. Log in with your developer credentials.

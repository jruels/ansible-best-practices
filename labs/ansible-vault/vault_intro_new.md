# Lab Title: Using Ansible Vault

## Lab Objective

In this lab, you will learn how to use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data in a playbook. You will create a new playbook that uses a vault-encrypted variable file to deploy a website on a Windows host.

## Lab Steps
Perform the following steps on Windows Target 1 in VS Code

1. In Visual Studio Code and open the "ansible-working" repository created in a previous lab.
2. Create a new directory named "vault" in the "ansible-working" repository.
3. In the "vault" directory, create a new file named "secrets.yml" and add the following content:

```
---
ansible_user: Administrator
ansible_password: JustM300
db_user: dbuser
db_password: pass1234
```

4. Encrypt the "secrets.yml" file using Ansible Vault with the following command:

```
ansible-vault encrypt vault/secrets.yml
```

When prompted, enter a password to use for encrypting the file.

5. Create a new playbook named "deploy_website.yml" in the "ansible-working" repository and add the following content:

```
---
- name: Ensure IIS is installed and started 
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes 
  become_method: runas
  become_user: Administrator
  vars_files:
    - vault/secrets.yml
  vars:
    ansible_connection: winrm
    ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
    service_name: IIS Admin Service   
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure IIS Server is present 
      win_feature:
        name:  Web-Server
        state: present
        restart: no
        include_sub_features: yes
        include_management_tools: yes  
    - name: Ensure latest web files are present
      win_copy:
        src: files/
        dest: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
        force: yes
    - name: Configure website
      win_template:
        src: templates/web.config.j2
        dest: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
      vars:
        db_username: "{{ db_username }}"
        db_password: "{{ db_password }}"
      become: true
- name: Ensure IIS is started
      win_service:
        name: "{{ service_name }}"
        state: started
```

6. Save the changes to the playbook and commit them to the "ansible-working" repository using the Source Control pane in Visual Studio Code.
7. Push the changes to the "ansible-working" repository on GitHub using the Source Control pane in Visual Studio Code.
8. Switch to the Ansible control host and navigate to the directory where the "ansible-working" repository was cloned.
9. Use the "git pull" command to update the cloned repository with the latest changes.
10. Run the "deploy_website.yml" playbook against the Windows host using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook deploy_website.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

When prompted, enter the password used to encrypt the "secrets.yml" file.

11. Verify that the website is deployed on the Windows host.
